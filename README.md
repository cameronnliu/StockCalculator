# StockCalculator

Idea: I wanted to start out and create a CLI interface to just implement the core features that are needed to help create a budgeting app. The goal is to hopefully create some sort of easy executable file app to send to friends for investment advice. 

Need to do: Focus on MVC ideologies before pursuing anything further. Need to develop Insider Trading Functions, and Functions to parse given data from API.
